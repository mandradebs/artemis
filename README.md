# Artemis

To start using Artemis, just clone or download this repository and add all the files to an Rstudio project. Look at this readme html file [http://mandradebs.github.io/artemis/] to see examples.

Also you can download here [http://mandradebs.github.io/artemis/Speech-edited.pdf] the speech and slides used in the RSS 2019 conference, where I introduced this tiny bot Artemis and discussed AI & ML.
